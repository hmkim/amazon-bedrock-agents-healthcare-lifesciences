## Core Capabilities

### 1. Entity Recognition and Extraction

Automatically identify medical and scientific entities in natural language queries:

**Example:**
```
User: "Show me clinical trials for lymphocytic leukemia with IL-23 expression"
Agent: [Uses extract_entities tool]
       Extracted entities:
       - "lymphocytic leukemia" (DISEASE, confidence: 0.95)
       - "IL-23" (GENE, confidence: 0.92)
       - "clinical trials" (context keyword)
```

**Supported Entity Types:**
- DISEASE: Diseases, conditions, syndromes
- DRUG: Medications, treatments
- GENE: Gene symbols (IL-23, TNF, BDNF)
- PROTEIN: Protein names
- ANATOMY: Anatomical structures, tissues, organs
- LAB_TEST: Laboratory tests, measurements
- PROCEDURE: Medical procedures, surgeries
- PHENOTYPE: Observable characteristics, symptoms
- ORGANISM: Species names
- CHEMICAL: Chemical compounds

### 2. Terminology Standardization

Convert variant medical terms to official ontology identifiers:

**Example:**
```
User: "What's the MONDO ID for myocardial infarction?"
Agent: [Uses ols_search_terms]
       MONDO:0005068 - myocardial infarction
```

**Advanced Standardization:**
```
User: "Standardize these terms: heart attack, MI, myocardial infarction"
Agent: [Uses extract_entities + ols_search_terms + generate_standardized_query]
       All terms map to: MONDO:0005068 - myocardial infarction
       Synonyms: heart attack, MI, myocardial infarction
       Parent terms: acute coronary syndrome
```

### 3. Query Disambiguation

Resolve ambiguous terms using ontological context:

**Example:**
```
User: "What type of entity is 'IL-23' in the context of gene expression?"
Agent: [Uses classify_entity_type]
       Entity type: GENE
       Reasoning: Used in gene expression context
```

### 4. Concept Expansion

Discover related terms and hierarchical relationships:

**Example:**
```
User: "Show me parent and child terms for diabetes"
Agent: [Uses ols_get_term_info + ols_get_term_ancestors + ols_get_term_children]
       Parent terms: metabolic disease, endocrine system disease
       Child terms: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes
```

### 5. Standardized Query Generation

Generate structured output for downstream agents:

**Example:**
```
User: "Find clinical trials for lymphocytic leukemia"
Agent: [Uses extract_entities → ols_search_terms → generate_standardized_query]

Output:
{
  "original_query": "Find clinical trials for lymphocytic leukemia",
  "standardized_query": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "original_text": "lymphocytic leukemia",
        "entity_type": "DISEASE",
        "standardized_terms": [
          {
            "ontology": "MONDO",
            "code": "MONDO:0004948",
            "preferred_label": "lymphoid leukemia",
            "synonyms": ["lymphocytic leukemia"]
          }
        ],
        "confidence": 0.95
      }
    ],
    "query_intent": "clinical_trial_search",
    "suggested_filters": {
      "disease_codes": ["MONDO:0004948"],
      "include_subtypes": true
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "tools_used": ["extract_entities", "ols_search_terms", "generate_standardized_query"],
    "confidence_score": 0.95,
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

## Key Ontologies

### Available via OLS MCP Server (Authoritative)

The agent accesses **200+ ontologies** through the [EBI Ontology Lookup Service](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies), covering diverse biomedical and life sciences domains:

**Most Frequently Used (Clinical & Research):**
1. **MONDO** - Disease classification and medical conditions (30,000+ terms)
2. **HPO** - Human phenotypes for clinical descriptions (16,000+ terms)
3. **GO** - Gene functions and biological processes (44,000+ terms)
4. **ChEBI** - Chemical compounds and drug substances (200,000+ terms)
5. **EFO** - Experimental factors and biomedical concepts

**Additional Domain Coverage (200+ ontologies):**
- **Anatomy**: UBERON, FMA (Foundational Model of Anatomy), CL (Cell Ontology)

Browse all ontologies: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies

### Available via LLM Knowledge (Suggestions)

The agent leverages Claude's training data knowledge for these ontologies:

1. **MedDRA** - Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (adverse events, medical history)
2. **SNOMED CT** - Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms
3. **ICD-10/11** - International Classification of Diseases
4. **RxNorm** - Normalized drug names and clinical drugs
5. **LOINC** - Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (lab tests)
6. **CPT** - Current Procedural Terminology (procedures and services)

**Important Distinction:**
- **OLS codes** = Authoritative, real-time API lookups from official sources
- **LLM codes** = Suggestions based on training data, require verification for production use

## Source Transparency & Prioritization

**CRITICAL**: The agent ALWAYS prioritizes authoritative OLS lookups over LLM suggestions and clearly indicates which source is used.

### Transparency in Responses

The agent will always include source attribution:

**OLS (Authoritative) responses:**
- "I found MONDO:0005068 for myocardial infarction from EBI OLS (authoritative source)."
- "According to EBI OLS, the ChEBI ID for aspirin is CHEBI:15365."

**LLM Knowledge (Suggestions) responses:**
- "Based on my training data, the MedDRA code is likely 10028596. Note: This is a suggestion - please verify with the official MedDRA browser for production use."
- "My training data suggests ICD-10 code E11. Verify with authoritative sources."

## LLM Knowledge vs Authoritative Lookups

The agent has two complementary ways to access ontology codes, with OLS always prioritized:

### Option 1: LLM Training Knowledge (`suggest_ontology_codes`)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Fast - no external API calls
- ✅ Works offline or when OLS unavailable
- ✅ Covers ontologies not in OLS (MedDRA, SNOMED CT, ICD-10/11, RxNorm, LOINC)
- ✅ Good for preliminary mappings and pre-filtering

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Based on training data (cutoff: January 2025)
- ⚠️ Not connected to live ontology databases
- ⚠️ Should be verified with authoritative sources for production use
- ⚠️ May have gaps or outdated codes

**Best for:**
- Quick suggestions for common terms
- MedDRA/SNOMED/ICD/RxNorm codes (not in OLS)
- Pre-filtering before detailed OLS lookup
- Offline or rapid-response scenarios

### Option 2: OLS API Lookups (`ols_search_terms`)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Authoritative - directly from EBI OLS database
- ✅ Up-to-date with latest ontology versions
- ✅ Complete hierarchies and relationships
- ✅ Production-ready for regulatory/clinical use
- ✅ 200+ ontologies supported

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Requires external API call (latency)
- ⚠️ Doesn't include MedDRA, SNOMED CT, ICD-10/11, RxNorm
- ⚠️ Requires OLS MCP server to be deployed

**Best for:**
- Production/regulatory use cases
- MONDO, ChEBI, HPO, GO, EFO lookups
- When complete hierarchy is needed
- Critical mappings requiring verification

### Recommended Strategy

**ALWAYS prioritize OLS over LLM knowledge:**

1. **FIRST**: Try `ols_search_terms` for ALL disease, chemical, gene, phenotype queries
   - Label results: "From EBI OLS (authoritative)"
   - Use for MONDO, ChEBI, HPO, GO, EFO, and 200+ ontologies
2. **SECOND**: Use `suggest_ontology_codes` ONLY for specific requests:
   - MedDRA, SNOMED CT, ICD-10/11, RxNorm, LOINC codes
   - Label results: "Based on training data - verify with authoritative source"
3. **Transparency**: ALWAYS indicate source in responses
4. **Production use**: Recommend OLS results for critical/regulatory applications

## Tool Selection: OLS-First Decision Tree

The agent follows this decision tree for tool selection:

```
User Query
    ↓
Is it about diseases, chemicals, genes, phenotypes, anatomy?
    ↓ YES
    ├─→ Use OLS tools (ols_search_terms)
    │   └─→ Inform user: "From EBI OLS (authoritative)"
    ↓ NO
    ↓
Is it SPECIFICALLY about MedDRA, SNOMED CT, ICD-10/11, RxNorm, LOINC?
    ↓ YES
    ├─→ Use suggest_ontology_codes
    │   └─→ Inform user: "Based on training data - verify with authoritative source"
    ↓ NO
    ↓
Try OLS first
    ├─→ If found: Use OLS result
    └─→ If not found: Try LLM knowledge as fallback
```

## Tool Workflow

The agent follows an intelligent OLS-first workflow based on query complexity:

### Simple Lookup Workflow
```
User Query: "What is the MONDO ID for diabetes?"
    ↓
ols_search_terms("diabetes", ontology="mondo")
    ↓
Return: MONDO:0005015 - diabetes mellitus
```

### Complex Multi-Term Workflow
```
User Query: "Standardize: heart attack, MI, stroke"
    ↓
extract_entities(query) → Identify: heart attack (DISEASE), MI (DISEASE), stroke (DISEASE)
    ↓
For each entity: ols_search_terms(entity_text)
    ↓
Return standardized codes for all terms
```

### Downstream Agent Workflow
```
User Query: "Find clinical trials for lymphocytic leukemia with IL-23"
    ↓
extract_entities(query) → ["lymphocytic leukemia" (DISEASE), "IL-23" (GENE)]
    ↓
For each entity: ols_search_terms(entity_text, ontology)
    ↓
generate_standardized_query(original_query, entities, ontology_results)
    ↓
Return: Structured query with codes, intent, and filters for clinical trials agent
```

The agent automatically determines the appropriate workflow based on query characteristics.

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites: Install Development Dependencies

Before deploying, install the required development and deployment tools:

```bash
cd agents_catalog/35-Terminology-agent
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

This installs:
- `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit` - For deploying to AgentCore Runtime
- `uv` - For building Python dependencies
- `mcp` - For testing MCP server deployments
- `boto3` - AWS SDK (if not already installed)
- `aws-cdk-lib` - CDK infrastructure deployment
- `ruff` - Code quality and linting

### Step 1: Deploy Backend Stack

**IMPORTANT**: Deploy the backend FIRST to create Cognito resources needed by the OLS MCP Server.

```bash
cd infra-cdk
npm install
cdk bootstrap  # Only needed once per AWS account/region
cdk deploy
```

This will deploy:
- **Cognito User Pool** - Authentication for frontend and M2M (required by OLS)
- AgentCore Runtime with `terminology_agent_with_ols.py`
- Gateway with authentication
- Memory and DynamoDB tables
- API Gateway for frontend

### Step 2: Deploy OLS MCP Server

Deploy the Ontology Lookup Service MCP Server (uses Cognito from Step 1):

```bash
cd ..
python deploy_ols_mcp_server.py --stack-name terminology-agent
python test_ols_client.py  # Verify deployment
```

The OLS MCP Server configures OAuth2 M2M authentication using the Cognito resources created in Step 1.

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend

```bash
cd ..
python scripts/deploy-frontend.py
```

### Step 4: Test the Agent

Test the deployed agent with automated medical terminology tests:

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite (remote agent)
uv run test-scripts/test-agent.py --test-suite

# Interactive chat mode (for manual testing)
uv run test-scripts/test-agent.py

# Local testing (requires agent running on localhost:8080)
uv run test-scripts/test-agent.py --local --test-suite
```

The test suite will:
- Run 5 automated medical terminology tests
- Test OLS integration (term lookup, hierarchies, multi-ontology search)
- Verify tool usage and responses
- Show pass/fail results with timing

You can also access via the frontend URL:
```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name terminology-agent \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`FrontendURL`].OutputValue' --output text
```

## Testing Examples

### Example 1: Simple Term Lookup (OLS - Authoritative)

```
User: "What is the MONDO ID for diabetes?"
Agent: [Uses ols_search_terms - authoritative OLS lookup]

       I found MONDO:0005015 for diabetes mellitus from EBI OLS (authoritative source).

       This is the official disease classification code used internationally.
```

### Example 2: Entity Extraction from Complex Query

```
User: "Show me clinical trials for lymphocytic leukemia with IL-23 expression in breast tissue"
Agent: [Uses extract_entities]

       Extracted entities:
       - "lymphocytic leukemia" (DISEASE, confidence: 0.95)
       - "IL-23" (GENE, confidence: 0.92)
       - "breast tissue" (ANATOMY, confidence: 0.88)

       [Then uses ols_search_terms for each entity]

       Results:
       - lymphocytic leukemia → MONDO:0004948 (lymphoid leukemia)
       - IL-23 → Found in GO and gene ontologies
       - breast tissue → UBERON:0000310 (breast)
```

### Example 3: Hierarchical Exploration

```
User: "Show me the parent and child terms for MONDO:0005068"
Agent: [Uses ols_get_term_info, ols_get_term_ancestors, ols_get_term_children]

       Term: myocardial infarction (MONDO:0005068)

       Parents:
       - acute coronary syndrome (MONDO:0005023)
       - heart disease (MONDO:0005267)

       Children:
       - ST elevation myocardial infarction
       - non-ST elevation myocardial infarction
```

### Example 4: Multi-Ontology Search

```
User: "Find 'insulin' in ChEBI and GO ontologies"
Agent: [Uses ols_search_terms with ontology filter]

       ChEBI Results:
       - CHEBI:145810 - insulin

       GO Results:
       - GO:0005179 - hormone activity (insulin)
       - GO:0042593 - glucose homeostasis
```

### Example 5: MedDRA Code Suggestion (LLM Knowledge - with transparency)

```
User: "What's the MedDRA code for myocardial infarction?"
Agent: [Uses suggest_ontology_codes - LLM training data]

       Based on my training data, the likely MedDRA code for myocardial infarction is:

       - **10028596**: Myocardial infarction (PT - Preferred Term)
       - 10028597: Acute myocardial infarction (PT)

       ⚠️ Important: These are suggestions from my training data (cutoff: January 2025).
       For production use, please verify with the official MedDRA browser at:
       https://www.meddra.org/

       Note: MedDRA is not available through EBI OLS, which is why I'm using
       training data suggestions rather than authoritative lookups.

       Would you also like me to check related ontologies in OLS (like MONDO
       for disease classification)?
```

### Example 6: Comprehensive Multi-Ontology Mapping (with clear source attribution)

```
User: "Map diabetes mellitus to all relevant ontologies"
Agent: [Uses OLS FIRST, then LLM knowledge for ontologies not in OLS]

       ## Authoritative Sources (from EBI OLS):

       **MONDO** (Disease Classification):
       - MONDO:0005015: diabetes mellitus
       - Child terms: type 1 diabetes (MONDO:0005147), type 2 diabetes (MONDO:0005148),
         gestational diabetes (MONDO:0005406)
       ✓ Source: EBI OLS - authoritative, production-ready

       **ChEBI** (Chemical Entities):
       - Related compounds: glucose, insulin
       ✓ Source: EBI OLS - authoritative

       ## Training Data Suggestions (verify before production use):

       **MedDRA** (Regulatory):
       - 10012601: Diabetes mellitus (PT)
       - SOC: Metabolism and nutrition disorders
       ⚠️ Source: Training data - verify with official MedDRA browser

       **ICD-10** (Diagnosis Codes):
       - E11: Type 2 diabetes mellitus
       - E10: Type 1 diabetes mellitus
       ⚠️ Source: Training data - verify with official ICD-10 sources

       **Recommendation**: Use MONDO codes (MONDO:0005015) for production systems
       as they are authoritative and up-to-date. Verify MedDRA and ICD-10 codes
       with official sources before use in regulatory contexts.
```

### Example 7: Standardized Query for Downstream Agent

```
User: "Prepare a query for clinical trials agent: lymphocytic leukemia"
Agent: [Uses extract_entities → ols_search_terms → generate_standardized_query]

       {
         "original_query": "lymphocytic leukemia",
         "standardized_query": {
           "entities": [{
             "original_text": "lymphocytic leukemia",
             "entity_type": "DISEASE",
             "standardized_terms": [{
               "ontology": "MONDO",
               "code": "MONDO:0004948",
               "preferred_label": "lymphoid leukemia",
               "synonyms": ["lymphocytic leukemia", "lymphoid leukaemia"]
             }],
             "confidence": 0.95
           }],
           "query_intent": "clinical_trial_search",
           "suggested_filters": {
             "disease_codes": ["MONDO:0004948"],
             "include_subtypes": true
           }
         },
         "metadata": {
           "tools_used": ["extract_entities", "ols_search_terms", "generate_standardized_query"],
           "confidence_score": 0.95,
           "warnings": []
         }
       }
```

## Environment Variables

The agent requires these environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `STACK_NAME` | CDK stack name | `terminology-agent` |
| `MEMORY_ID` | AgentCore Memory ID | From CDK output |
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | AWS region | `us-west-2` |

These are automatically configured by the CDK deployment.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent doesn't use OLS tools

**Check 1**: Verify OLS MCP server deployment
```bash
python check_ols_mcp_deployment.py
```

**Check 2**: Verify SSM parameters exist
```bash
aws ssm get-parameter --name /terminology-agent/ols-mcp-server/mcp-url
```

**Check 3**: Check agent logs
```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/terminology-agent-runtime --follow
```

### OLS tools return errors

**Check 1**: Test OLS MCP server directly
```bash
python test_ols_client.py
```

**Check 2**: Check OLS server logs
```bash
aws logs tail /aws/bedrock-agentcore/runtimes/ols_mcp_server-ChEmBE8HM3-DEFAULT --since 10m
```

## System Prompt Summary

The agent uses a comprehensive system prompt that:

1. **Defines its role** as a Medical Terminology Standardization Agent
2. **Lists available tools** and when to use them
3. **Provides structured response format** for consistency
4. **Prioritizes key ontologies** for medical/clinical use
5. **Includes usage examples** for common patterns

## Deployment Workflow

User: "What ontologies are available for immunology research?"
Agent: [Uses ols_search_ontologies]

       EBI OLS provides 200+ ontologies covering diverse biomedical domains.
       For immunology, I found:

       1. **Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)** - Epitopes and immune responses
       2. **Cell Ontology (CL)** - Immune cell types (T cells, B cells, NK cells)
       3. **Protein Ontology (PR)** - Immune proteins (antibodies, cytokines)
       4. **Gene Ontology (GO)** - Immune processes (immune response, inflammation)
       5. **Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)** - Immune-related phenotypes
       6. **MONDO** - Immune system diseases (autoimmune, immunodeficiency)
       7. **ChEBI** - Immunomodulatory compounds

       Explore all 200+ ontologies at: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies

       Would you like to search for specific immune-related terms across these ontologies?
```

**Example: Cross-Domain Ontology Search**
```
